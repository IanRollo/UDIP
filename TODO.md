# For the developers: TODOs
1. If necessary, use the location of fields on the forms to help parse their meaning 
2. Evaluate other outputs to see if they can help us increase accuracy (note to Ian: remind me what this means?)
3. Modularize the prompt so that each identified doc type gets its own prompt 
4. Package this all into an .exe 
5. Factor individual pieces of functionality out into classes or helper functions, give them real unit tests
